#sf-project-skeleton
The skeleton is optimized for fast sf project bootstrapping and includes following bundles, ideas and scripts:

* Asm/php-utilities
* default nginx (dev) config for linking into sites-enabled. Best used with maschmann/devbox-ansible
* Grunt/Bower integration as a Assetic-replacement (not ready yet)
* some helper classes, inheriting from Controller and ContainerAwareCommand to ease e.g. Template-finding
* basic project structure, following the one-bundle + core lib approach

# installation
just do the normal composer install.
